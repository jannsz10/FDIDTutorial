# Forward Difference-in-Differences

This repository contains the Python and Stata code to estimate the Forward Difference-in-Differences estimator. The Python installation is under construction, but Stata users may install it by doing:
```
net install fdid, from("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jgreathouse9/FDIDTutorial/main") replace
```
where you may find the ancillary files with the Basque and HCW data. A Stata tutorial for FDID will also be posted soon.
